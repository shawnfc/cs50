# Project 0

My website tells the user a bit about myself, my interests, and how to follow me on social media.

My home page let's the user know that they're welcome to the site and what my name is. My about page talks about my profession and has an image of me. My recreation page mentions my interests. Lastly, my follow me page allows the user to stay connected to me via social media.
